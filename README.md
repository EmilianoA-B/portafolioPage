# Personal Portafolio
Hello! This is the code for my personal portafolio. It is insipired in a modern music player, each project represents a song, it's quite simple, but all the projects are meant to be served statically through a JSON

## Technologies used
I used HTML, CSS & JavaScript to make the site, nothing else. To deploy the site I used nginx and docker, a dockerfile as well as a nginx.conf is included in the repository if you want to mount it yourself

## How does it look?
The site looks like this on a webpage, it also has a mobile view.
